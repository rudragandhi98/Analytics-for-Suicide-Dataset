# Analytics-for-Suicide-Dataset

Utilized the who_suicide_statistics csv file from Kaggle. 

Performed simple analysis to showcase the data. Created a plot to show highest number of suicides by country, suicides for the given population, number of suicides over the years, ratio of suicides for female and male.
Created a normal distribution plot for the entire population. Also, estimated the population parameters where sample count is constant but sample size varies. According to that, created another normal distribution. 
Created a bar chart to compare the sample means with the mean of the whole population. Performed other analysis.
